    <p align="left">For anyone unfamiliar with what RGB video is see this <a href="http://atarilabs.com/meat/2000/1201_videoprimer.shtml">Video
        Primer</a>.<br>
      SCART pinouts and signal info can be found <a href="http://utopia.knoware.nl/users/eprebel/SoundAndVision/Engineering/SCART.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p align="left">SCART (aka Peritel or Euroconnector) cables for home video
      game consoles
      aren't standard, they are different for each console. The manufacturers
      have taken full
      advantage of this and, in what I assume is an effort to save a few cents,
      often place
      necessary components (esp. coupling capacitors) of the RGB output circuit
      inside the SCART
      cable. Since only a small fraction of people who own a console use/require
      a SCART cable
      it slightly reduces the overall cost.</p>
    <p align="left">This page contains circuit diagrams to aid anybody wanting
      build/repair/adapt these cables, as well as pinouts and a short
      description of the RGB
      video output (75 ohm driver) circuit. Enjoy...</p>
    <p align="left"><big><big>Notes</big></big></p>
    <p align="left">TVs with SCART inputs are only common in Europe and
      Australia (mainly
      because we share a similar TV standard (thus TV designs) with most of
      Europe and the TV
      manufactures just leave the connectors in place). If you are from a
      somewhere where TVs
      with SCART inputs are rare then don't despair, some of the upper market
      TVs offer RGB
      input in the form of 4 phono sockets, one for each colour and one for
      composite sync. If
      such a TV can't be found for a reasonable price, then look around for an
      old RGB computer
      monitor that is compatible with the TV horizontal scan frequency, such as
      the commodore
      1084 monitor. Alternatively, if a suitable monitor can't be located and
      you're good with
      electronics, then consider building a <a href="../vga2arc/vga2arc.htm#acvid">SCART
        to
        arcade monitor</a> adapter.</p>
    <p align="left">The SCART spec states that to switch to RGB mode the CVBS
      Status pin must
      be fed 12V and the RGB Status (aka Fast Blanking) pin be fed 1-3V. Some
      games consoles
      only output 5V which may or may not be adequate. If the TV doesn't switch
      and there is no
      way to manually force a 'video mode' (such as a button on the remote
      control) then an
      external 12V supply may be required. In cases where the TV is a widescreen
      model or has a
      widescreen mode feature, applying only 5v to the RGB Status pin may force
      the TV into 16:9
      widescreen mode.</p>
    <p align="left">In the diagrams I have drawn all the SCART ground pins
      connected together.
      This isn't required but it's a good idea to connect to at least two ground
      pins (usually
      17 and 18). If you're using mini-coax to connect the RGB video
      (recommended if the cable
      is going to be long) then ground pins 5, 9 and 13 provide handy places to
      solder the
      shield. The reverse applies to the console end of the cable. I've only
      drawn one ground
      connection but it may be a good idea make use of other ground connections
      (if there are
      any).</p>
    <p align="left">Cables which run video and audio signals together without a
      seperating
      shield around the audio wires may cause an annoying 50 or 60hz buzzing
      sound in the audio
      which vaires in volume with the picture content. This is caused by the
      capacitive coupling
      of the two wires running next to each other. The longer the cable is the
      more capacitance
      between the wire. The best way to avoid this is to run a seperate cables
      for audio and
      video join them together again at the SCART end. </p>

      Connector is a 10 pin mini-DIN type. While it's a standard connector, it's
      extremely rare
      so don't expect to be able to buy one from the local electronics shop (or
      anywhere for
      that matter). The Saturn puts out luma/chroma (s-video) as well as the

      For some unknown reason the RGB output circuits differs between the NTSC
      and PAL consoles.
      As a result the cables are different too (though I somehow doubt Nintendo
      had any
      intention of releasing a SCART lead for the NTSC SNES).<br>

      Nintendo are up to their old tricks again. The PAL console outputs RGB but
      not s-video and
      the NTSC model outputs s-video but not RGB. Therefore this cable will only
      work on a PAL
      Gamecube. However, it is possible to get RGB from an NTSC Gamecube by
      modifying the
      official component video cable. Here are some guides to the procedure:<br>

      Like the Gamecube, RGB video is only available from the PAL Wii.<br>

      Proprietary A/V connector (different to the proprietary A/V socket used on
      previous
      nintendos). Pinouts: 1 left audio, 2 right audio, 3 composite video, 4 +5v
      DC, 5 ground, 6
      ground, 7 red video (luminance/NTSC), 8 mode select, 9 green video
      (chrominance/NTSC), 10
      mode select, 11 blue video, 12 ground, 13 +12v DC. Pins 14-16 are for
      something called a
      Japanese D-Terminal Cable. Mode select pins are normaly left unconnected.
      When they are
      connected together, component video (YUV/YPbPr) will output from pins 7, 9
      and 11 in place
      for RGB/S-video. The DC voltage on pin 13 will drop to 5v for widescreen
      games (will it?).<br>

      </u><strong>1/7/05</strong> - Added diagram for the Nintendo Gamecube.
      Added some
      datasheets. Fixed an error in the NTSC and PAL SNES diagrams (had pins
      3&amp;4 swapped on
      the diagram). I also modified the PAL SNES diagram a bit (the 12V output
      didn't supply
      enough current to feed SCART pin 16). Thanks to David Bielen for the
      Gamecube related
      info.<br>
      <strong>18/5/05</strong> - Fixed errors in megadrive/master system cable
      (had it drawn
      back-arsewards), neo geo (din 8 connector drawn incorrectly), and pal snes
      (missing
      resistor from video to ground). Info thanks to this <a href="http://www.rikkyo.ne.jp/esd/yoshikun/cable_making/">Japanese
